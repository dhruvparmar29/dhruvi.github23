            A very original, and good, series.
            SSJAniFan9 October 2003
            A lot of the shows on Cartoon Network premiered here, as well as some which have been popular even though they did not last long. I think these episodes were a lot better than some of the series. In, "Chicken From Outer Space," Courage, Muriel, and Eustace did not speak, thus relying on more visual gags than sappy one-liners like the later episodes. "Crime 101," and "Meat Fuzzy Lumkins," the superhero spoof for PPG was much funnier(on a side note, Kath Soucie, who also voiced Dexter's mom in this, did the voice of Bubbles, not Tara Strong), the jokes used in Johnny Bravo were a bit more adult, Cow and Chicken actually dealt with smoking, and even Dexter was a bit more humorous(the original short, now known as "Changes," has got to be one of the craziest shorts ever made). These cartoons were hilarious, and fans should know that these are worth checking out the original shorts to see what lead to their favorite series. Sadly, the WACS isn't on TV anymore, but lots of old Hanna-Barbera videos which contain old episodes of Johnny Quest(both Classic and New Adventures) and the first set of Scooby-Doo videos have these shorts contained with them.
            
            BOTTOM LINE: These were great. Maybe Cartoon Network can release all of the WACS shorts on DVD</h3></p>
